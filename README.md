## Foodie — MVP (v0)
We are exploring this application through SDSU's Zahn Innovation Platform Launchpad which is an incubator for startups.
Foodie is a lightweight MVP designed to reduce group decision fatigue when choosing where to eat.
It focuses on speed, fairness, and simplicity rather than discovery depth. 

This repository contains the v0 prototype built in v0 and used for early testing and validation.

## What This MVP Does

The v0 MVP helps small groups:

- Narrow restaurant options quickly

- Balance preferences and constraints

- Reach a decision with minimal friction

The core problem addressed is not taste, but logistics and group fairness.

## Key Features (v0)

Simple input flow (group size, budget, distance, basic constraints)

Visual-first voting on restaurant options

Equal-weight participation to reduce dominance

Mobile-first interface

## How This MVP Is Used

This version is intentionally minimal and optimized for learning.
It has been used for:

Early Neal Tests

Track 1 vs Track 2 experiments

In-person group testing with college students

It is not intended for monetization or long-term use.

## Built With

v0 (UI and flow prototyping)

## React-based components

Client-side logic only (no backend)

## Known Limitations

No accounts or saved history

Limited dataset

No real-time collaboration

These are intentional to keep focus on decision mechanics.
